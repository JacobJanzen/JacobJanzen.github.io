    <h1>Jacob Janzen's website</h1>
    <p>
      This website is designed to be as minimal as possible. It's written in
      HTML with minimal CSS and JavaScript where needed. There are no frameworks
      and no bloat. It's currently hosted on GitHub pages, but I intend to
      eventually move it over to a self-hosted server when I get the hardware
      (this is years away).
