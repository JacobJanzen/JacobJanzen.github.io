      <h1>Jacob Janzen's Website</h1>
      <p>
        This website is designed to be as minimal as possible. It's written in
        HTML and CSS while avoiding JavaScript as much as humanly possible.
        There are no frameworks and no bloat. It's currently hosted on GitHub
        pages, but I intend to eventually move it over to a self-hosted server
        when I get the hardware (this is years away).
