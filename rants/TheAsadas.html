      <h1>Talking About The Asadas (2020)</h1>
      <p>
        I finally got around to rewatching this movie last night after watching
        it on a plane one time. It really stuck with me because of a scene near
        the end that made me cry. I usually don't really talk about movies all
        that much but I felt the need to discuss this one.
      </p>
      <p>
        On rewatch, the film did not hold up as well as I remembered. I still
        enjoyed it, but I found the plot and pacing to be somewhat odd. It felt
        like two disjoint movies, one about a struggling photographer trying to
        follow his dreams and one about trying to find hope in the aftermath of
        the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake. I think both stories worked well on their
        own, but I think that they failed to transition effectively between the
        two.

        The first half of the movie shows Masashi taking up photography after
        seeing his father gifts him the old family camera. He is very interested
        in photography as a child before becoming directionless after graduating
        from his university with a prestigious award for a family photo he took.
        Years later, he becomes inspired once again and begins taking many
        family photos, each with funny themes where the family pretends to be in
        various different scenarios such as pretending they were all on a car
        racing team or that they were a family of gangsters. He publishes a book
        of this photography and initially has little success before winning an
        award for it and achieving a lot of success. I found this section to be
        very poorly paced. He pretty quickly goes from his book being an abject
        failure to a huge success. It feels like it was missing something, but
        the family photos were cute and fun and the struggles of wanting to do
        something, but never doing anything to satisfy that urge to create is
        immensely relatable to me.

        The second half of the movie was significantly more emotionally
        stimulating and I think that it deals with the devestation of such a
        natural disaster very well. In particular, I appreciated how it dealt
        with a young child who had lost her father in the earthquake. After his
        death she was very distraught because she could not find any photos of
        her father in the collection of photos that protagonist Masashi Asada
        and other volunteers had helped salvage. At the same time, Masashi's
        father was having a medical emergency and his family thought he may pass
        away. Similarly, there were few photos of him before Masashi took up
        photography as his father was always the one behind the camera.
        Realizing this, Masashi quickly comes back to Tōhoku to take a family
        photo for that child. Wearing the father's old watch to take a photo, he
        made the family realize that their father was actually in every single
        one of those photos, just behind the camera instead of in front.

        The movie ends with a fake-out about the father's death. It shows the
        family surrounding him as he lays down as though dead. His wife falls
        forward to sob, and then you hear a camera shutter and the family all
        start laughing. This was just another of Masashi's fun themed family
        photos. The scene gave me a good chuckle.
      </p>

        Overall, I found the movie to be very cute and I found that it did a
        great job of dealing with the tragedy of natural disaster. I really wish
        that it did a better job of pacing the first half and tying the themes
        of the first half to the second half. It felt disjointed and that is
        disappointing to me because I think it could have been a really
        fantastic movie if those issues were worked through with a little more
        script editing.
