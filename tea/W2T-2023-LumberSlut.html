        The liquor is black and smells like wood. It has a pleasant, smooth
        woody flavour. Not at all complex, but still enjoyable. I like to brew
        this one by putting an unmeasured chunk of leaves at the bottom of my
        thermos and fill it with boiling water. It doesn't seem to oversteep no
        matter what I do to it. Good daily drinker.
