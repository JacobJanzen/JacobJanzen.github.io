      <p>
        I won't lie; I initially bought this one for the funny name, but it's
        actually a pretty decent inexpensive tea. Normally, roasted oolongs
        aren't my favourite, but I do enjoy some good duck shit.

        The liquor is a pale orange with a milky texture. The liquor is a pale
        orange with a milky mouthfeel. The flavour is somewhat nutty but also
        evokes a sense of dried fruit. Dates and almonds are the most prominent
        flavours that I taste in it.
